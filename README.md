Course project from "The Modern JavaScript Tutorial" on Udemy. I put it here to be able to tweak it and expand it.

The code is not 100% identical to the course. Mainly, the route handler logic differs somewhat in a couple of places.

This version also features:

- Increase / decrease quantities in cart
- CSRF protection
- Sign out button and landing page
- Small bugfixes
